## Welcome

Welcome to the **Training Modules on Selected Statistical Methods** repository. This resource is designed to help students learn and apply selected statistical methods with integrated R code and video demonstrations. The modules combine theoretical explanations with practical examples using **R** and **RStudio**.

---

## Purpose

The purpose of this project is to:
- Provide structured training modules that facilitate learning of statistical methods.
- Demonstrate statistical techniques through integrated R code examples.
- Enhance understanding through case studies and video tutorials.

---

## About the Resource

This repository contains:
- Source code for the training modules.
- An R package, **CSUBstats**, offering custom functions tailored for this resource. This package includes data from case studies and additional functions from other packages.
- Demonstrations on how to run the provided code in **RStudio**, supporting a practical learning approach.

**R** was chosen for its open-source nature, cross-platform compatibility, extensive online documentation, and the support of a large community. **RStudio** provides a user-friendly IDE that facilitates the learning experience.

## Getting Started with CSUBstats

An R package (`CSUBstats`) has been developed for this resource, providing custom functions along with case study data. To install and load the package, run the following commands in R:

```r
install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("emontoya2/csubstats")
library(CSUBstats)
```

## What This Resource Is Not

This resource is not intended to be an exhaustive guide to all statistical methods or their R implementations. It covers only a subset of statistical techniques to provide a solid foundation for further exploration. Users are encouraged to consult additional resources to broaden their understanding of statistical methods.
