## Purpose of this resource

The purpose of this project is to help students learn and apply selected statistical methods. Each module focuses on specific areas with integrated R code offering students an informative way to learn and practice these methods. Most R code within a given section are linked to video demonstrating how to run the code in RStudio.

R is chosen because it is open source, platform independent, remains among the most popular and best statistical software packages, provides great on-line documentation, and is well supported with a large and useful user community from a diverse range of backgrounds. Furthermore, most sections incorporate R code, enabling students to learn and practice the material as they progress through a given module. To use R, the integrated development environment (IDE) RStudio will be used, which has made R more user-friendly for many users.
 


## What this resource is not 

This resource does not aim to provide an all-encompassing guide to statistical methods or their implementation in R. Numerous statistical methods and various ways to conduct these methods in R can be utilized in practice, many of which are not covered in these modules.  That being said, the concepts and techniques presented are intended to enhance the reader's ability to apply the covered methods to their research, as well as to connect their statistical knowledge with more advanced methods.
