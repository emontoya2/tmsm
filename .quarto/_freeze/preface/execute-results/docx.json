This book book is utilized by our general education statistics course (Math 1209.)\n\n-   *Introductory Statistics* by @openintro2. This is another open education resource that it is very well written more in the style of traditional textbooks.\n\nR and RStudio will also have to be installed (see the appendix for installation instructions).\n \n \n \n## Acknowledgements\n\nthe grant, R, RStudio, quarto.... \n\n \n\n## Contributing\n\nContributions are encouraged on any part of the project, including:\n\n- improvements to the text, e.g. clarifying unclear sentences, notation, and fixing typos;\n- changes to the R code to make it easier to read or to do things in a more efficient way; \n- suggestions on topics to consider adding;\n- examples or case studies to considering integrating into the project; \n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\nContributers: .\n:::\n",
