Do external incentives promote creativity? To address this, researchers investigated whether people would tend to display more creativity when they are thinking about intrinsic or extrinsic motivations [@amabile1985 and @sleuth]. In this study, undergraduate students of similar creative writing experience were randomly assigned to one of two groups . One group received intrinsic questionnaires, and the other received extrinsic questionnaires. \n\nThe intent of this treatment (the questionnaires) was to have student establish a thought pattern concerning a type of motivation (intrinsic -- doing something because it is rewarding or enjoyable; extrinsic -- doing something because we want to earn a reward or avoid punishment).  Researchers speculated that those who were thinking about intrinsic motivations would display more creativity than subjects who were thinking about extrinsic motivations. All subjects were instructed to write a Haiku, and those poems were evaluated for creativity by a panel of judges\n\nThe resulting experimental data is shown below, displaying the creativity score (`Score`) and the type of questionnaires (`Treatment`) assigned for a given undergraduate. Do the data provide evidence that creativity scores are affected by type of motivation?\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n```{=html}\n<div id=\"htmlwidget-0016def7b62d40a49537\" style=\"width:100%;height:auto;\" class=\"datatables html-widget\"></div>\n<script type=\"application/json\" data-for=\"htmlwidget-0016def7b62d40a49537\">{\"x\":{\"style\":\"bootstrap4\",\"filter\":\"none\",\"vertical\":false,\"caption\":\"<caption>Data from Amabile, T.

Are the scores between the two groups different enough to convince you that those thinking about intrinsic motivations display more creativity than subjects that were thinking about extrinsic motivations?  If not, how much larger should the mean be? Answers to such questions require inferential methods that will be discussed in a future chapter.    \n\nFor now, be aware that the data provides convincing evidence that subjects thinking about intrinsic motivations would receive a higher creativity scores than those thinking about extrinsic motivation (two-sided p-value = .006). The 95% confidence interval of (-7.010, -1.277) shows that the mean creativity score for the extrinsic group is expected to be between 1.277 and 7.010 lower than the mean creativity score for the intrinsic group.\n\n### Scope of inference {-}\n\nWe may conclude that the differences in creativity scores between groups was caused by motivation questionnaire type since the treatment (motivation questionnaire type) was randomly assigned to the undergraduates.  We may only infer this for the subjects in the study and not a larger population since the students were not randomly selected from a population.   \n\n ",
