After opening RStudio for the first time, you will see the RStudio interface, which consists of three panes. Next,  open the script editor by selecting *File > New File > R Script* to make the script editor appear. RStudio should look something like what you see below but perhaps with different colors:\n![RStudio interface](images/rstudioInterfaceeditor.png){#fig-rinter}\n\n\n## The layout of RStudio\n\nA brief description of each pane follows:\n\n+ The upper left pane is the **R Script file**.  This is where will type in commands to be executed in the script editor. Writing and saving a series of **R** commands  in the script file makes it easy to reuse or modify code at a later time.\n\n+ The lower left pane is called the  **console**  pane. Every time you launch **RStudio**, it will have the same text at the top of the  console telling you the version of **R** that you're running.  Below that information is the R*prompt*  (the symbol `>`).  As its name suggests, this prompt is really a request, a request for a command.  It is here where **RStudio** will tell **R** what to do.  This is the most important pane because this is where **R** actually does stuff.\n+ Upper right pane\tcontains your **environment/history** pane.\n  + In the *environment *  tab you can see which data and values **R** has in its memory. **R**'s memory is called an environment. \n  + The *history*  tab shows what has been typed before. \n  + Don't worry about the rest of the tabs.\n+ Bottom right pane is the **files/plots/packages/help** pane.   \n    + In the *Files* tab you can browse and select files to open.\n    + The *Plots*  tab will show any plots that you create.\n    + The rest of the tabs we will revisit as needed.\n    \n    \n## Getting familiar with R\n    \n To get familiar with R, it will first be used as a calculator. To get started, enter the `2 + 2` in the script editor.  Once typed, highlight it and select the \"Run\" button (see image below) \n\n![Using the \"Run\" button](images/datamod/plus2re.png){#fig-2plus2}\n\n::: {.callout-important icon=true}\n## Objects, assignments, and evaluation\n\nExecuting the command `2 + 2` only executes/runs the command in R. That is,  RStudio was used to to tell R to add two plus two, and R responded with `4` in the R console.  It did not save the result, it simply *evaluated* `2 + 2`.  \n\nIf you want to save the result of `2 + 2` so that you can use it later, then we have to tell R to store the result by *assigning* the result to an *object* you can access later. Think of an R object as anything that holds/stores information (some data structure)\n\n\nTo assign the result of `2 + 2` to an object called `x`, type `x <- 2 + 2` on a new line in the editor. Also, assign the result of `3+5` to an object called `X`.  Then highlight these line and select \"Run\".\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n:::\n\n \nNote that either `=` or `<-` may be used for assignments.\n\n:::\n\n![Assigning the evaluation of `2 + 2` to an object called `x`](images/datamod/plus2stored.png){#fig-assignexample}\n\nNote the following:\n\n- The R code `x <- 2 + 2` translate to \"assign the result of 2 plus 2 to an object called `x`\".  \n  \n- You can also see the new object `x` in the environment on the upper right pane.\n\n- R is case-sensitive!  `x` and `X` are distinct.\n\n- Get into the habit of saving things in **R objects** so that they  can be accessed  at later time.  As long as your *RStudio session* remains open, **RStudio** keeps any **R objects** that you defined in it's memory. \n\n- Once you end your session, RStudio loses what it has stored in its memory. Next time an  RStudio session is started, **no** R objects will appear in its  memory.  Is this a problem? Later you will see that this is not a problem! \n\n- At its most basic level, R can be viewed as a fancy calculator.  While we won't be using **RStudio** do algebra problems, it is a good way to get familiar with **RStudio**.  \n\n- Upon selecting \"Run\", the result of the above appears in the console pane, preceded by the command you executed, and prefixed by the number 1 in square brackets `[1]`.  The `[1]` indicates that this is the first (and in this case only) result from the command.\n\n- Many commands will return multiple values. Try the following one by one, where each is typed on a new line and then selecting \"Run\" after typing the command in the editor:\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n25*10\n\t\n5/2\n\n2 + 2\n```\n:::\n\n\n- After running these commands, you should note the R prompt: `>`.\n\t- The `>` prompt means that **R** is content and ready for a new command or input. \n\t- Please note that spacing is not an issue with **R**. For example, `5 / 2` is the same as `5/2`. However, using spaces makes the code **easier** to read and catch mistakes.\n\n\n## Comments\n\nEverything that is typed after a `#` sign is assumed to be a comment and is ignored by R. Adding comments to R scripts is useful because it will help one recall what the commands or lines of code does. In the editor,  type the following and select \"Run\":\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Comments are ignored by R!\ny <- 1 + 3    # this command tells R to compute 1 plus 3 and assign it an R object called  y\n```\n:::\n\n\nNote that `y` is now in RStudio's memory, and its value can be accessed by typing y on a new line and selecting \"Run\". Now, type the following in your editor on a new line and then select \"Run\":\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n#z <- 3 - 7  # this code  is ignored because of # ```\n```\n:::\n\n\nNote that this code ignored because of `#`.  Get into the habit of using comments!\n\n\n## Creating and saving your RStudio script \n\nIt's always good practice to save your RStudio script. Edit the script that we have started to look like this:\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n### Name: Your-name-here\n### File description: Some misc R code  \n\n\n2 + 2\n\nx <- 2 + 2\n\n25*10\n\n5/2\n\n2 + 2\n\n```\n:::\n\n \nNext, save the **RStudio** script/file by selecting *File > Save as*. Save the text file as an .R file.  Any **RStudio**  *script* should be saved as a *.R* file.     \n\n\n## Installing required packages\n\nThere are many *packages* (also called *libraries*) that come installed with R or that can be installed to expand the ability of R. There are a few additional packages that need to be installed. The following packages are specifically designed to make **R** more accessible and easier for data analysis:\n\n- `tidyverse`: This packages provide a  collection of R packages designed for data science. Functions front his packages will be utilized for aspects of importing data and data management. \n\n- `mosaic`: This packages provides a number of functions that makes some basic data analysis tasks easier.  \n\n \nTo install these packages, in the **R console** type the following command:\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ninstall.packages( \"tidyverse\" )  # no spaces within quotation marks!\n```\n:::\n\n\nHit enter. Activity will start occurring in the **R console**. This may take a few minutes to complete. During the installation process, if R requests that\n\t+ an CRAN mirror be selected for downloading, any USA mirror will do.\n\t+ the personal library on your computer be used, answer yes.  This ensures that admin privileges are not required for installation. \n\t+ packages be updated, please agree to the updates.\n\nWhen it is done installing, it should say something similar to \"The downloaded binary packages are in...\" right above the R prompt `>`.  This mean the packages were installed without error. Now repeat the sames step for the package `mosaic`. Again, this may take a few minutes to complete.  \n\nAlternatively, you can select *Tools* from the RStudio menu, followed by *Install packages*. Enter the name of the R package under \"Packages (separate...)\" and click \"Install\". Activity will then start occurring in the **R console** as when using `install.packages()`.\n\n\n::: {.callout-important icon=true}\n## Loading packages\n\nR packages will only have to installed once on the computer that is being used. However, once the package is installed, you will have to load it into the workspace (R's memory) before it can be used every time you start a new RStudio session. If you are using a different computer, you will have to install these packages again.\n\nTo load a package, run the command `library( `*package-name*`)`. For example. to load the `mosaic` packages, run the following in R:\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary( mosaic )  # no quotation marks!\n```\n:::\n\n\n:::\n\n\n## Some useful tips\n\n\nSome things to remember when using RStudio:\n\n+ Always use an *R script* (a *.R* file) to save your work. \n\n+ R is case-sensitive!\n\n+ Does the code in the **R console** keep going and going and...? Hit the `Esc` key once or twice!\n\n+ If you see a `+` prompt in the R console, it means the console is waiting for more input.\n\n+ Comment your code using `#`. It's amazing what you can forget quickly. \n\n+ You are expected to look back at the appendix or other segments in this resource if you forget something along the way, as you would for any other software that you are starting to learn.\n\n+ Some sections will contain examples or templates of how to do certain analysis.  You job will primarily will be to edit the templates to reflect the data that you are working with.\n\n+ Getting an error message? An online search for the error message will be useful.\n\n ",
