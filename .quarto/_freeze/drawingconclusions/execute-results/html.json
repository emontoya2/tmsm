However, it is important to consider how data are collected so that they are reliable and help achieve the research goals. Important concepts related to data collection:\n\n+ **Population**: The entire collection of objects or individuals that you want to study.\n\n+ **Individual**, **case**, or **subject** :  A person or an object that is a member of the population being studied\n\n+ **Sample**: A part of the population that is selected for the study.\n\nIf the goal is to draw conclusions about the population of interest, rather than just the cases or subjects in the sample, a **representative** sample obtained through random sampling is required.\n\n\nCommon sampling techniques include:\n\n- Simple random sampling (SRS) -- Randomly and independently select cases from the population, each case is equally\nlikely to be selected.\n\n![Simple random sampling](images/design/srs.png){#fig-srs}\n\n\n- Stratified sampling -- Population is divided into groups called strata.  The strata are homogeneous and an SRS is taken from each stratum.\n\n![Stratified sampling](images/design/strat.png){#fig-strat}\n\n\n- Cluster sampling -- Population is divided into groups called clusters that are not necessarily homogeneous.  A random sample of clusters is selected and all observations from each sampled cluster are used.  \n\n![Cluster sampling](images/design/cluster.png){#fig-clust}\n\n::: {.callout-important icon=true}\n## A note about the size of the sample\n\n**Common misconception**: If the size of a sample is relatively small compared to the population size, the sample cannot possibly accurately reflect the population. Not true! The random selection process allows you to be confident that the resulting sample will reflect the population, even when the sample consists of only a small fraction of the population.\n\nStatistical inferential methods **always account for the sample size**. The larger the sample size, the more information is available, which results in a more precise answer compared to a smaller sample size with less information.\n:::\n\n\n## Relationships among variables  \n \nWhen two variables show some relationship or connection with one another, they are called **associated variables**. If it is believed that a variable might affect or be associated with changes in the another variable, then in such cases, the first variable is designated  the **explanatory variable** and the second the **response variable**.  \n\nFor example, can the height of a tree provide a reasonable estimate of its volume? Do certain types of diets significantly affect the early growth of chicks? Such questions can be explored using numerical and graphical summaries of data. However, whether the trends or patterns seen in these graphs can be attributed mostly to sampling, natural variability, or random error is uncertain.\n\n::: callout-note\n\nRecall the case study given in @sec-casestudy1  This data set has three variables (two categorical and one numerical variable):  level of exposure of light intensity (`Light`), turbidity level exposure (`Turbidity`), and the percentage of larvae that survived (`Survival`).  The questions posed where: Do levels of  light intensity (measured in $\\mu mol/m^2/s$)  affect survival rates of early-stage larvae early-stage Delta smelt larvae? What about levels of turbidity (measures in nephelometric turbidity units (NTUs))? Since we would like to know whether these factor variables might affect  the percentage of larvae that survived, `Light` and `Turbidity` are explanatory variables and `Survival` is the response variable. \n\n:::\n  \nTwo common ways to visualize the relationship between variables are scatter plots and box plots. In R, we create these plots using the `xyplot()` and `bwplot()` functions, respectively. Below are examples of these plots being used to explore the relationships between variables in two different datasets. Both of these functions are also discussed in @sec-numsum.\n\n\n::: {.callout-tip icon=false}\n\n## R functions\n```\n### xyplot( y ~ x , data , xlab, ylab, main, xlim, ylim, col, pch )\n# y: Replace y with the name of the response numerical variable.\n# x: Replace x with the name of the explanatory numerical variable.\n# data: Set equal to dataframe name\n# xlab: set equal to the label for x-axis (optional).\n# ylab: set equal to the label for y-axis (optional).\n# xlim: set equal to the  range of the x-axis (e.g., c(0, 1)  provides\n#       a lower bound 0 and upper bound of 1) (optional).\n# ylim: set equal to the  range of the y-axis (optional).\n# main: set equal to the title of the plot (optional).\n# col:  Set equal to desired color for points (optional).  \n# pch:  Set equalt o a number between 1-25 to change the point symbol (optional).  \n#\n#\n### bwplot( y ~ x , data , xlab, ylab, main, xlim, ylim, box.ratio, \n             varwidth, horizonal, panel  )\n# x: Replace x with the name of the explanatory categorical variable.\n# horizontal: Set equal to TRUE if boxplots are to be drawn \n#            horizontally.

However, inferential methods would be necessary to determine whether these differences between diets are due to natural or sampling variability. The same goes for the trend seen in the scatter plot.\n\n\n## Basics of experimental design\n\nThe following concepts of experimental design enable researchers to conclude that differences in the observed response data are likely due by the treatments and not  reasonably attributable to only chance:\n\n- Randomization:  Researchers randomly assign experiment units into treatment or conditions (also called  randomized group assignment). This  ensures that an experiment does not favor one experimental condition over any other and tries to create \"equivalent\" experimental groups in the sense that the treatment groups  are as much alike as possible.  \n \n- Replication: The more experimental data collected, the more precise our estimate of the effect of the treatment on the response.  \n\n- Controlling: Researchers assign treatments to cases, and attempt their best to control any other differences in the groups.\n\n\n- Blocking: A technique to include another factor variable that is not of primary interest in the experiment because it is believed it contributes to variation in the response. The experimental units may be grouped or blocked based on this factor variable. Randomization is then applied within each block to the treatment conditions. Blocks should be homogeneous.  \n\n\nFor those interested in learning more about the design and analysis of experiments, *Math 4220* is an applied course that explores various strategies for constructing and executing experiments that can be applied across the social, physical, and life sciences.  This course enhances the ability of one to  design experiments, carry them out, and analyze the resulting data.  \n \n\n \n\n\n## Scope of inference  \n\n\nThe scope of inference of a study (from a statistician's perspective) addresses two questions: \n\n+ Do these results provide evidence for a causal relationship? (cause-and-effect or causation)\n\n+ Can the results of the study be generalized to a population? (generalizability)\n\nOne can only establish if changes in the explanatory variable cause changes in the response variable through a randomized experiment.  The answer to the second question is provided by the sampling method used to obtain the data.  If the sample was randomly selected, then results from a study can be reasonably generalize to the population from which the sample was taken. In terms of a randomized experiment, the same applies to the treatments considered. Otherwise, the results can not be generalized to a population.\n\n\n![The table reflects what can be concluded if an association is established (scope of inference)](images/design/scopeTable.png){#fig-scope}\n\n\n\n::: callout-note\n\nRecall the case study given in @sec-csdelta. The treatments (low, medium, and high light intensities) were imposed on the subjects (early-stage Delta smelt larvae), but the treatment levels were not randomly assigned to the experimental units.  Therefore, results from the study can not say whether changes in light intensity causes changes in survival rates. While there is an association between these variables, other possible explanation may exist for this relationship. \n\nFurthermore, since the fish were not randomly selected for the study from some larger population, nor were the light intensities randomly selected, any conclusions from the study apply only to the subjects in the sample and the treatments considered. Therefore, the findings cannot be generalized to a larger population of fish or light intensity in general.\n\n:::\n\n\n",
