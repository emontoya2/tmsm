This open source project was developed by [Eduardo L. Montoya](https://emontoya2.github.io/).  If you find the contents useful, please cite or acknowledge this project to encourage further use by others.  Please use the following citation:\n\n> Montoya, E. L. (2022).  Training modules on statistical methods. GitHub repository, https://github.com/emontoya2/tmsm\n\n\n## Purpose of this resource\n\nThis is an open source project whose goal is to enable students to improve their ability to apply appropriate statistical methodologies. When appropriate, sections within a module are linked to video tutorials on how to conduct the analysis using the open-source software R. R is used because it is open source, platform independent, remains among the most popular and best statistical software packages, provides great on-line documentation, and is will-supported with a large and useful user community from a diverse range of backgrounds. Further, R code is integrated into each module to enable one to learn and practice the material as they work though a given module.  To use R, the integrated development environment (IDE) called RStudio will be used. RStudio has made R more user-friendly for many. \n \n## Organization of the modules\n\nThe material is organized according to the order topics of this nature are introduced in practice.  Modules will then  follow similar patterns: Module core material organized into sections that use the case studies to illustrate important concepts and/or applications of methods.  Those new to R should work through the appendix.  If you have used R in the past, but have not imported *.csv* files nor used a formula expression of the form `response ~ explanatory`, then the reader should review @sec-importdata and @sec-UsingRfuns.\n\nAll modules have R code embedded.  With in a given module, the R code is self-contained, although a given R function is only described when they are first used.  Since the code is only self-contained with in a given module, code to import a particular data set or load a particular R package may appear multiple times in different modules. Also, any subsequent uses of a given function will not provided a description but the reader may search for the name of the function in the search bar provided in the upper left of the module.\n \n \n## What this resource is not \n\nThe concepts and methods covered are not meant to be  all encompassing of statistical methods, nor is the software aspect of the modules.  There are many statistical methods that one can utilize in practice that these modules do not cover.  That being said, it is intended that the concept covered in the modules will improve the ability of one to connect their statistical knowledge with more advanced methods. \n\n \n  \n \n \n## License\n\nThis resource is **free to use**, and is licensed under the [Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivs 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/) License. \n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n:::\n",
