It is an appropriate and common way to organize data, especially if collecting data in a spreadsheet. The case study data frame illustrates many important data basics:\n\n-   A **variable** is any characteristic whose value may change from one individual (or object) to another.\n\n-   **Data** result from making **observations** either on a single variable (called **univariate** data) or simultaneously on two or more variables (called **multivariate** data).\n\n::: callout-note\nEach row in the data table above represents a single early-stage Delta smelt larvae in the sample. The formal name for a row is a **case** or **observational unit**. The columns represent characteristics of interest for each early-stage Delta smelt larvae, where each column is referred to as a **variable**. Here, the only characteristics that are of concern for each larvae are the level of exposure of light intensity (`Light`), turbidity level exposure (`Turbidity`), and the percentage of larvae that survived. For example, the first row represents a early-stage Delta smelt larvae that was exposed to a light intensity of 4.5 $\\mu mol/m^2/s$ and a turbidity level of 2 NTUs, where only 56.8 % of larvae survived under these conditions.\n:::\n\nNote the format of the case study data:\n\n-   Each variable forms a column.\n\n-   Each observation forms a row.\n\n-   Each value must have its own cell.\n\nThen data is stored in this format, it is called **tidy data** [@wickham2014].\n\n![Tidy data format. source: @wickham2016r](images/tidydata.png){#fig-tidydata}\n\nTidy data provides a consistent format to organizing data, and it makes a clear distinction between a variable, an observation, and a value. Most importantly, this format will make it easier to manage, visualize, and model the data. While one may be tempted to not store their data in this format, eventually it is very likely that the non-tidy data will need to be converted to a tidy format in order to efficiently analyze it using statistical software.\n\n## Types of variables\n\nVariables in a statistical study can be classified as either **categorical** or **numerical**. A variable is categorical if the individual observations are categorical responses. Such observations may be labels, peoples attributes or opinions, etc. A variable is numerical (or quantitative) if its corresponding observations are a numerical values that are measured or counted. With numerical variables, it's sensible to add, subtract, or take averages or medians of its observed values.\n\nAlternatively, we would not classify a variable, such as film genres (action, comedy, mystery, drama, historical and etc.), as numerical since the average and sum of genre does not have any meaning. Instead, we would consider film genres as a categorical variable. A variable is categorical if the individual observations are categorical responses. Such observations may be labels, peoples attributes or opinions, etc.\n\n**Factor variables** refer to the software's treatment of categorical variables. The levels of a factor variable refers to the value that a categorical variable takes on. For example, the variable \"Born before 1999\" may take on levels 0 and 1, with 0 representing being born before 1999 and 1 representing being born on the year 1999 or after. This factor variable is a two-level factor variable. If the levels have a natural ordering. A factor or categorical variable with these properties is called an **ordinal variable**, while a factor variable without this type of special ordering is called a nominal variable. For readability, factor variables will be treated as a nominal factor variables in modules.\n\nNumerical variables can be further classified into two types depending on their possible values:\n\n-   **discrete**\n\n-   **continuous**\n\nA numerical variable is **discrete** if its possible values correspond to isolated points on the number line. A numerical variable is **continuous** if its possible values form an entire interval on the number line. For example, discrete data are usually counts and continuous data are often measurements.\n\n::: callout-note\nThe case study data frame consists of three variables labeled as `Light`, `Turbidity`, and `Survival` in the data frame.\n\n-   `Survival` is a continuous numerical variable. These observations can take a wide range of values.\n\n-   `Light` and `Turbidity` are both factor variables, with each having levels low, medium, and high.\n:::\n\n![Breakdown of variables into their respective types](images/varTypes.png){#fig-vartype}\n\n\n## Relationships among variables  \n \nA researcher may be interested in the relationship between two or more variables may be interest. For example, do higher temperature tend to correspond to a higher or lower than average utility bill?  Do certain type of diets significantly affect the early growth of chicks in terms of weight?\n\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\" fig.asp='0.5' warnings='false'}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Total Utility bill (in dollars) vs average temperature.](studydesign_files/figure-html/fig-energybills-1.png){#fig-energybills fig-align='center' width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\" fig.asp='0.5' warnings='false'}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Boxplots at each factor level.](studydesign_files/figure-html/fig-chicks-1.png){#fig-chicks fig-align='center' width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n \nSuch questions can be explored using numerical and graphical summaries of data.  The graphical summaries above suggest that chicks on diets 3 and 4 in this sample tend to have a higher weight than thouse under diet 1 or 2, although inferntial methods would be needed to determine if these differences between diets  are not just the result of natural variability.  For utility bill and temperature, the summary suggests that at higher temperatures, the bills tends to be lower. However, a closer look reveals that the relationship between these variables is due more gas consumption rather than electricity consumption.   \n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\" fig.asp='0.5' warnings='false'}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Gas and electric bill vs average temperature.](studydesign_files/figure-html/fig-energybills2-1.png){#fig-energybills2 fig-align='center' width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nWhen two variables show some relationship or connection with one another, they are called **associated variables**. It is appropriate to consider if changes in one variables might affect changes in the other.  For example, if there is a cold wave, then the graphical summary suggest this lead for gas bills to increase. In such cases, the first variable is designated  the **explanatory variable** and the second the **response variable**.  Hypothesized relationships between the explanatory and response variable will be formally assessed in a later module. \n\n\n \n\n \n\n::: callout-note\n\nRecall the case study on the delta smelt.  This data set has three variables (two categorical and one numerical variable):  level of exposure of light intensity (`Light`), turbidity level exposure (`Turbidity`), and the percentage of larvae that survived (`Survival`).  The questions posed where: Do levels of  light intensity (measured in $\\mu mol/m^2/s$)  affect survival rates of early-stage larvae early-stage Delta smelt larvae? What about levels of turbidity (measures in nephelometric turbidity units (NTUs))? Since we would like to know whether these factor variables might affect  the percentage of larvae that survived, `Light` and `Turbidity` are explanatory variables and `Survival` is the response variable. \n\n:::\n\n\n\n\n## .csv files {#sec-csv}\n\nThe statistical software used for exploring and analyzing data is R (to be discussed later). To simplfy the learning of R, as well as providing a consistent approach to using R, it is assumed that any research data will be saved in the tidy format using a comma separated values (*.csv*) file. A *.csv* may be viewed with a spree sheet program such as Microsoft Excel. It is assumed readers have used an excel spreadsheet. If not, please view the tutorial [Excel Tutorial for Beginners](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwbho0CgEAE) .\n\nTo store data in a *.csv* file, first input and organize the data in Excel. Organize your data in an Excel worksheet, such that the first row (Row 1) contains the column (variable) names and each subsequent row contains all the necessary information for each data point. Next, save the worksheet as a *.csv* file type.\n\n![Sample .csv file in tidy format](images/excel.png)\n\n## Codebooks\n\nAn important task in a data based research project is to document the structure and content of project dataset. This can be done in the form of a **codebook**, a file that lists at least the names of the variables, variable descriptions, and data source. Sometimes it may also provide the variables' type (e.g., continuous, categorical) and levels of factor variables (e.g., 1 = disagree,..., 3 = agree). Writing a codebook is an important step in the managing the data aspect of your research project. The codebook will serve as an important reference for the researcher and any collaborators, and there are multiple approaches for creating a codebook, with Excel being a popular choice. The next section contains a sample codebook for the case study data.\n\n## Sample codebook for case study data\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Delta smelt case study data frame has the following dimensions:\n\n| Feature                | Result |\n|:-----------------------|-------:|\n| Number of observations |     20 |\n| Number of variables    |      3 |\n\n#### Codebook summary table {.unnumbered}\n\n| Label                                                                                                                                                                     | Variable        | Class   | \\# unique values | Missing | Description |\n|:-----------|:-----------|:-----------|-----------:|:----------:|:-----------|\n| low dosage (4.5 micromols per square meter per second), medium dosage (6.75 micromols per square meter per second), high dosage (9 micromols per square meter per second) | [**Light**]     | factor  |                3 | 0.00 %  |             |\n| low dosage (2 NTUs), medium dosage (5.5 NTUs), high dosage (9 NTUs)                                                                                                       | [**Turbidity**] | factor  |                3 | 0.00 %  |             |\n| Percentage of early-stage Delta smelt larvae (0-40 days post hatch) that survived                                                                                         | [**Survival**]  | numeric |               20 | 0.00 %  |             |\n\n#### Variable list {.unnumbered}\n\n##### Light {.unnumbered}\n\n*low dosage (4.5 micromols per square meter per second), medium dosage (6.75 micromols per square meter per second), high dosage (9 micromols per square meter per second)*\n\n\\bminione\n\n| Feature                 |  Result |\n|:------------------------|--------:|\n| Variable type           |  factor |\n| Number of missing obs.  | 0 (0 %) |\n| Number of unique values |       3 |\n| Mode                    |   \"low\" |\n| Reference category      |     low |\n\n\n```{=tex}\n\\emini\n\\bminitwo\n```\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](studydesign_files/figure-html/Var-1-Light-1.png){fig-align='center' width=384}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\\emini\n\n-   Observed factor levels: \"high\", \"low\", \"med\".\n\n\\fullline\n\n##### Turbidity {.unnumbered}\n\n*low dosage (2 NTUs), medium dosage (5.5 NTUs), high dosage (9 NTUs)*\n\n\\bminione\n\n| Feature                 |  Result |\n|:------------------------|--------:|\n| Variable type           |  factor |\n| Number of missing obs.  | 0 (0 %) |\n| Number of unique values |       3 |\n| Mode                    |   \"low\" |\n| Reference category      |     low |\n\n\n```{=tex}\n\\emini\n\\bminitwo\n```\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](studydesign_files/figure-html/Var-2-Turbidity-1.png){fig-align='center' width=384}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\\emini\n\n-   Observed factor levels: \"high\", \"low\", \"med\".\n\n\\fullline\n\n##### Survival {.unnumbered}\n\n*Percentage of early-stage Delta smelt larvae (0-40 days post hatch) that survived*\n\n\\bminione\n\n| Feature                 |       Result |\n|:------------------------|-------------:|\n| Variable type           |      numeric |\n| Number of missing obs.  |      0 (0 %) |\n| Number of unique values |           20 |\n| Median                  |        59.56 |\n| 1st and 3rd quartiles   | 55.79; 67.24 |\n| Min. and max.           | 45.02; 89.09 |\n\n\n```{=tex}\n\\emini\n\\bminitwo\n```\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](studydesign_files/figure-html/Var-3-Survival-1.png){fig-align='center' width=384}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\\emini\n\n\\fullline\n\nReport generation information:\n\n-   Created by: Eduardo L.
