To import .csv files, the function `read.csv()` is used and this function comes with R. Note that if your data are stored in an excel sheet (.xlsx), the function `read.csv()` can be replaced with `read.xlsx`. This functions is from the `openxlsx` package. If your excel sheet is a *.xls* file, convert it using excel to *.xlsx*. Installation of R packages are discussed later in this section.\n\n\n####  Importing data via a URL {-} \n\nImporting data here will be illustrated  using the \"MLB salaries (2010)\" data set.  This .csv file of this dataset is located at the following URL: [http://www.csub.edu/~emontoya2/datasets/mlb2010.csv](http://www.csub.edu/~emontoya2/datasets/mlb2010.csv). \n \nThis approach only works if the *.csv* has a url location. The \"MLB salaries (2010)\" data set is located  at the following URL:\n\nLink: [http://www.csub.edu/~emontoya2/datasets/mlb2010.csv](http://www.csub.edu/~emontoya2/datasets/mlb2010.csv)\n\nTo import, run\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nmlbDataImport = read.csv( \"http://www.csub.edu/~emontoya2/datasets/mlb2010.csv\" )\n```\n:::\n\n\nNote that `read.csv()` reads in the data into R and we are assigning the resulting data set to an object called `mlbDataImport`.  Since this object consist of the dataset, such objects are called a  *data frame*.  A data frame is the most common way of storing data in R. For our purpose, the term dataframe and data set will be used interchangeably.  Note that the `mlbDataImport` data frame should now appear under the \"Environment tab\". \n\nFurther note that `read.csv()` only  requires the location of the file or file path (assuming the data was stored as discussed in @sec-csv).  Since the data is located at this URL, we use the URL.  If the data is saved on your computer, then replace the url with the file path or  with `file.choose()`.\n\n\n::: {.callout-important icon=true}\n## URLs\n\nThe URL must be in quotations and NO spaces at the start after the quotation or right before the end of the quotation.  For example, you will get an error if you use the following urls\n\n+  `\" http://www.csub.edu/~emontoya2/datasets/mlb2010.csv\"`\n\n+  `\"http://www.csub.edu/~emontoya2/datasets/mlb2010.csv \"`\n\n+  `\" http://www.csub.edu/~emontoya2/datasets/mlb2010.csv \"`\n\nThey look similar to what we used but it has spaces within the quotation marks!\n\n:::\n\n\nAn R function called `summary()` can provide the names of the variables and other information by using \n:\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nsummary( mlbDataImport ) \n#>     player              team             position             salary       \n#>  Length:828         Length:828         Length:828         Min.   :  400.0  \n#>  Class :character   Class :character   Class :character   1st Qu.:  418.3  \n#>  Mode  :character   Mode  :character   Mode  :character   Median : 1093.8  \n#>                                                           Mean   : 3281.8  \n#>                                                           3rd Qu.: 4250.0  \n#>                                                           Max.   :33000.0\n```\n:::\n\n \nNote that this data frame has four variables but that R treats the categorical variables as character variables. By default, R treats any categorical variables with categories labeled by letters or words as character variables. If the categories are instead labeled with numbers, R considers the categorical variable to be a numerical variable. Instructions on how to tell R to treat  categorical variables as categorical and not numerical/character will be covered later. \n\n\n### Importing data from your computer {-}\n\nDownload the *.csv* file below onto your computer.  Make sure to  note where the file is saved. Depending on the browser settings, after clicking on the link below, the file will either open in the browser and it will be downloaded.  \n \n[http://www.csub.edu/~emontoya2/datasets/sampledata.csv](http://www.csub.edu/~emontoya2/datasets/sampledata.csv)\n\nAfter saving this *.csv* file, one can take a \"point and click\" approach to importing data.  Like most software, RStudio has a toolbar where you can access many commands. To import data using the toolbar menu, select *File>Import Dataset> From Text (base)*. Then select your *.csv* file.  If your data are stored in an excel spreadsheet (.xlsx) in tidy form, then select \"From Excel\".  \n\nAlternatively, if you know the file path for the spreadsheet, you can run following\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# by putting in \"file.choose()\", this tells R that you want to browse for and select the csv file\nImportFromDrive = read.csv( file.choose() )\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n:::\n\nThis automatically opens a window that allows you to browse for your *.csv* file. Select your file and click on *Open*.  You should see the following in the console  \n![Importing data using `file.choose()` to specify file location ](images/filechoose.png)\n\nThe data set `ImportFromDrive` should appear in the *Environment* tab in the upper right panel where it displays the number of observations and variables.  One may also replace `file.choose()` with the location of the file in quotation marks.\n  \n \n## Using R functions  {#sec-UsingRfuns}\n\nR functions are either ready use when you start a new RStudio session or an R package must be loaded to use a function from that package.  The syntax of an R function consist of the function name followed by parentheses that contain argument(s). The R functions used in this resource will generally consists of the name of the data frame that is in tidy form and one or more of the following arguments:\n\n- Names of response variable as spelled in the data frame\n\n- Names of explanatory variable(s) as spelled in the data frame\n\n- additional optional arguments\n\nR has many built-in function or function that become available once a library is loaded. For example, the `mean( )` function computes the mean of sample of data. \n\n\n##  Summarizing data with R\n\nExploring data using graphical and numerical summary statistics will be discussed in @sec-summaries. \n  For now, a brief introduction to graphing and computing summary statistics is provided.  When wanting to summarize a single variable, functions to create graphical and numerical summaries follows the general form `task( ~ x , data)` where `x` is the variable you want to graph or compute a statistic of. Depending on the summary, we may have to specify some additional things.  If the variable `x`  is a variable in the data frame, then data would be set equal to the name of the data frame. The names used for `x` and the name of the data frame must be the names that R has given the data set and variable. `task` would be replaced with the name of the function. For bivariate, the form becomes `task( y ~ x , data)` becomes where `y` represent the dependent variable and `x` is the explanatory variable. Most R tasks covered in the modules will follow this general form. The expressions `y~x` or `~x` are called formulas in R.\n\nRecall that we imported the MLB dataset and we stored it in a data frame called `mlbDataImport`.  Here, the task is to create a histogram of `salary`.  `salary` represents the salary (in $1000s) of a given baseball player in 2010.  Again, the basic formula is `task( ~ x , data)` where `task` would be replaced with the name of the function to create the desired graph.  **RStudio** refers to histograms as `histogram`.  The variable of interest is `salary` and it would replace `x`.  The argument `data` is set equal to `mlbDataImport`.\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary( lattice ) # load the lattice package. This package provides the histogram function\nhistogram( ~ salary  , data=  mlbDataImport )\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](a3-basicsR_files/figure-html/gr2-1.png){fig-align='center' width=528}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nTo  compute the mean salary of these baseball players we replace `task` with `mean`.  As with the histogram, \n`x` is replace with the name of the variable `salary`, and `data` is set equal to `mlbDataImport`:\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary( mosaic ) # load the mosaic package. This provides the  mean function \nmean( ~ salary  , data=  mlbDataImport )\n#> [1] 3281.828\n```\n:::\n\n\nSuppose you wanted to compute the average salary for each position. To so, we can tell RStudio to compute the mean by levels/groups of a grouping variable. A grouping variable groups data into categories or groups. Grouping variables are categorical variables.  When summaries are computed based on the levels or groups of the grouping variables, they are called side-by-side or comparative summaries. \n\nTo summarize the data conditional on a value of categorical variable, the general formula becomes  `task( ~ x | gfactor , data)` or `task( y ~ x | gfactor , data)`, where `gfactor` represent the categorical variable, typically called the grouping variable. Here, the task is to compute the mean salary for each potion, so  the grouping variable is `position`:\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nmean( ~ salary | position , data=  mlbDataImport )\n#>           Catcher Designated Hitter     First Baseman         Infielder \n#>          1937.220          5235.714          5826.521           770.575 \n#>        Outfielder           Pitcher    Second Baseman         Shortstop \n#>          3753.926          2999.197          3022.723          2844.146 \n#>     Third Baseman \n#>          4641.286\n```\n:::\n\n\n\nNote that the names of the variables (e.g., `salary`, `position`, etc.) are spelled exactly as they appear in the data frame.\n\n::: {.callout-important icon=true}\n## Function arguments\n\nFunctions in R will have a number of *arguments*.  An argument is piece of information that is provided to the function in order to execute the requested task, such a compute a summary statistic or create a graph. From hereinafter, functions used in the modules will describe the function in the following ways:\n\n::: {.callout-tip icon=false}\n## R functions\n\n```\n### task( arg1 , arg2,  arg3, ...)\n# arg1: Description of what information is needed for argument 1\n# arg2: Description of what information is needed for argument 2\n# arg2: Description of what information is needed for argument 2\n# and so on\n\n```\n:::\nSome arguments will be required, others optional depending on the function.  More often than not, the functions will require at least the following arguments to run: A formula (such as `y~x` or `~x`) and the name of the data frame (`data=`'*name of data frame*').  The phrase `task` will be replaced with the name of the function, such as `mean` or `histogram`.\n\n:::\n\n\nIn some sense, you can use the code provided in this resource as a template  to adapt to your dataframe and the names of the variables within your dataframe (discussed in the next section). \n\n\nAll functions used in the module will only be described when they are first used.  Any subsequent uses of a given function will not provided a description but the reader may search for the name of the function in the search bar provided in the upper left of the module.   \n\n\n## Adapting the R code provided for your data and interest\n\nIn this section, we demonstrate how to adapt the provided code to your own data frame and variables of interest by using formula expressions with examples from two different datasets. Recall that most functions will have a layout of  `task( y ~ x , data)` or `task( y ~ x , data)`. For this illustration, we use two dataframes, `ChickWeight` and  `trees` dataframe. Both of these dataframes are built-in with R. Note the following variable names in each dataframe:\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# \"ChickWeight\" measurements on weight, time since birth, \n# age, and diet plan of chicks\nnames( ChickWeight )\n#> [1] \"weight\" \"Time\"   \"Chick\"  \"Diet\"\n\n# \"trees\" dataset contains the height, girth,\n# and volume measurements for 31 trees\nnames( trees ) # this dataset comes built-in with R\n#> [1] \"Girth\"  \"Height\" \"Volume\"\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n### A univariate summary: {-}\n\nThe following computes the weight of the chicks:\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Compute the mean weight\nmean( ~ weight  , data=  ChickWeight )\n#> [1] 121.8183\n```\n:::\n\nNote that weight is spelled `weight` and not `Weight` or `WEIGHT` since it appears as `weight` in the dataframe. \n\nThe code below computes the mean volume of the 31 trees:\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Compute the mean\nmean( ~ Volume  , data=  trees )\n#> [1] 30.17097\n```\n:::\n\n\n \nNotice the similarity between these two commands. The only differences are the names of the data frames and the variable names (spelled exactly as they appear in the respective data frames, keeping in mind that R is case sensitive). The general form used here is: `task( ~ x, data )` \n\n \n\n### A bivariate summary: {-}\n\nThe following creates a scatterplot of the weight of a chick against the time since birth:\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Load the R package lattice\nlibrary(lattice) # provides xyplot() \n\n# create the scatterplot\nxyplot(weight ~ Time  , data=  ChickWeight  )\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](a3-basicsR_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-4-1.png){fig-align='center' width=528}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThe code below plots the volume of a tree against height of a tree:\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# create the scatterplot\nxyplot( Volume ~ Height  , data=  trees  )\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](a3-basicsR_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-5-1.png){fig-align='center' width=528}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n \nNotice the similarity between these two commands. The only differences are the names of the data frames and the variable names (spelled exactly as they appear in the respective data frames, keeping in mind that R is case sensitive). The general form used here is: `task( y ~ x, data )` \n\n\n## Exporting graphs\n\n\nThere are 3 methods for exporting a plot in R. After creating a plot, go to the *Plots* tab in the lower right pane. Find the \"Export\" button located in the upper right corner of the plot tab. Click on the \"Export\" button and three options will be given:\n\n- \"Save Plot as Image\": This option allows you to save the plot as an image file (such as png or jpg). Click on this option, and a  box will open where you can choose the file format, resolution, and dimensions for the exported image. After selecting the options, click \"Save\" to save the image file to your computer.\n\n- \"Save Plot as PDF\": This option allows you to save the plot as a PDF file. Click on this option, and a box will open where you can choose the file name, dimensions, and other options for the exported PDF. After adjusting the settings, click \"Save\" to save the PDF file to your computer.\n\n- \"Copy Plot to Clipboard\": This option allows you to copy the plot to your clipboard. You can then paste the plot directly into other applications (such as Word, PowerPoint, etc.)as an image.\n\n\n## Using custom R functions\n\nSometimes, this resource will require the usage of what may be called custom functions. Some of these custom functions are wrappers[^1]  for R functions that come with R, while others are entirely new functions that were created. The reason for creating these custom functions is to provide a more consistent and streamlined way to perform certain tasks.\n\n\nAny time custom functions are used, they must first be sourced. For example, suppose a function called `my_function()` is provided by the `file my_functions.R`, and that this file is located in the following file path or location:  `C:/Users/YourName/Documents/my_functions.R`. This function is saved in the \"Documents\" folder.  If the code below is executed, it would source the file `my_function.R` so that the R `my_function()` function is in R's memory:\n\n\n```\nsource(\"C:/Users/YourName/Documents/my_functions.R\")\n```\n\nNote that any time you start a new RStudio session, you would need to source the `my_functions.R` file again in order to use the `my_function()` function. This is because R does not automatically remember custom functions that were sourced in previous sessions. \n \nTo use the custom functions provided in this resource, you will need to download them from the repository and update the file path in the `source()` function to reflect the location where you saved the functions on your own system. \n \n \n[^1]: A wrapper function is a function that calls another function or a set of functions to simplify or extend tasks.  \n\n \n",
