The mean or average is the most common way to measure the center of a distribution. A common way to measure spread or variability of the distribution is the standard deviation.  \n\nHere, we denote the mean of sample or sample mean by $\\bar{x}$. The sample standard deviation is denoted by $s$.  The function `mean()` and `sd()` computes the mean and standard deviation of a sample of data, respectively: \n\n::: {.callout-tip icon=false}\n\n## R functions\n```\n### mean( ~ x , data, na.rm)\n# x: Replace x with the name of the variable of interest\n# data: Set equal to dataframe name\n# na.rm: Should missing values be remove? The \n#       default is FALSE. Set equal to TRUE if\n#       missing values are to be excluded.\n#\n### sd( ~ x , data, na.rm)\n#\n```\n:::\n\nMany of the R functions used in these modules will have identical arguments. Therefore, while the arguments will be provided for any functions used, arguments such as `x`, `data`, ... will generally no longer be described. \n\nOther measures of the center and spread of the distribution used in practice are the median and  interquartile range (IQR) range, respectively.  The median, denoted $M$, is the (middle) value separating the upper half from the lower half of the ordered sample of data.   The IQR measures the spread of the middle half of the data.  Measures of center are generally used to describe what a \"typical\" value in the data, where as measures of spread quantify the amount of variability in the sample.   The function `median()` and `iqr()` computes the median and IQR of a sample of data: \n\n::: {.callout-tip icon=false}\n\n## R functions\n\n```\n### median( ~ x , data, na.rm)\n#\n### IQR( ~ x , data, na.rm)\n#\n```\n:::\n\n::: callout-note\n\nThe case study data given in @sec-csdelta consist of a single numerical variable:  `Survival`.

Like bar graphs, the histogram consists of bars with widths determined by the bins. The higher the bar, the higher the relative proportion of observations that fall in the respective bin\n\n\nGenerally, attention should be paid to certain features of the distribution, such as\n\n- Overall pattern of graph\n    - symmetric?\n    - skewed right (a few unusually large measurements, the longer tail is on the right side)?\n    - skewed left (a few unusually small measurements, the longer tail is on the left side)?\n- Outlying,  extreme observations, or values that are far away from the bulk of the data?\n\n\nThe function `histogram()` creates a histogram:\n\n::: {.callout-tip icon=false}\n\n## R functions\n```\n### histogram( ~ x , data , xlab , ylab , main , type , nint , xlim , ylim, col )\n# xlab: Set equal to the label for x-axis (optional).\n# ylab: Set equal to the label for y-axis (optional).\n# main: Set equal to the title of the plot (optional).\n# type: Set equal to \"percent\",  \"count\", or \"density\" (default).\n# nint: Set equal to the number of desired bins (optional).\n# xlim: Set equal to the  range of the x-axis (e.g., c(0, 1)  provides\n#       a lower bound 0 and upper bound of 1) (optional). \n# ylim: Set equal to the  range of the y-axis (optional). \n# col: Set equal to desired color.

A relative frequency histogram is a histogram where relative frequencies are plotted on the y-axis. The relative frequencies are provided as percentages with `type=\"percent\"`. A density histogram (`type=\"density\"`) is just a modified relative frequency histogram in that the area of each rectangle equals the relative frequency of the corresponding class, and the area of the entire histogram equals 1.\n\n::: callout-note\n\nThe case study given in @sec-casestudy4 provides the BMI values for various regions and countries.

The two boundaries of the box are called the first quartile (the 25th percentile) and the third quartile (the 75th percentile). Extending out from the box, the whiskers reflect the range of data outside of the box and reach the minimum and the maximum values, unless unless there are potential outliers (points beyond the whiskers).  When the median is closer the first (third) quartile than the median, the distribution is potentially skewed left (right).  \n\nAn extension of the boxplot is a violin boxplot or plot. This plot is a hybrid of a box plot and a kernel density plot (think of a kernel density plot as a smooth density histogram). The violin boxplot conveys the same information as the boxplot, but provides better picture of distribution.

With a QQ-plot, the observed values of a sample are plotted against the expected values of a theoretical distribution, usually a normal distribution. If the sample data are approximately normally distributed, the QQ-plot will show points on a scatterplot that approximately or roughly follow a straight or linear line. We limit our discussion to normal QQ-plots, which plot the sample quantiles of a sample against the quantiles of a normal distribution.

If the tails of a QQ-plot wander off in opposite directions but follow a linear line in the middle, it is a sign that the distribution of the data resembles a heavy-tailed distribution. On the other hand, if the points follow a \"u\" or \"n\" shape, it indicates that the data distribution is skewed, with clearer \"u\" or \"n\" shapes indicating stronger skewness.\n\n\n## Two or more numerical variable {#sec-multinumvar}\n\nA scatterplot graphically summarizes the relationship between two numerical variables.

The factor variable in such summaries is typically called a grouping factor variable. \n\nConditional plots may also be created by having the graphical summary appear in a single panel for each level of the factor variable, which can be achieved by using the `| gfactor` element within the formula expression, where `gfactor` represents the grouping factor variable.\n\n::: {.callout-tip icon=false}\n\n## R functions\n```\n### bwplot( ~ y | gfactor , data , xlab, ylab, main, xlim, ylim, box.ratio, \n             varwidth, horizonal, panel  )\n# y: the variable of interest.\n# gfactor: The grouping variable. \n#\n### stripplot( ~ y| gfactor , data , xlab, ylab, main, xlim, ylim, \n#                                    jitter, horizontal)\n#\n```\n::: \n\n\n::: callout-note\n\nHere, the relationship of `AQI` and `county` is explored  by graphically summarizing `AQI` the at the factor levels of `county`.\n\n\n\n```{r }\n#| label: fig-xyfactorplots\n#| fig-subcap:\n#|   - \"Vertical boxplots\"\n#|   - \"Horizontal boxplots\" \n#|   - \"Violin plots\" \n#| layout-ncol: 2\n#| layout-nrow: 3\n#| echo: true\n#| message: false\n#| warning: false\n\n# For this type of conditional vertical violin plot, use the following formula\n# expression: y ~ 1 | gfactor  \nbwplot( AQI~ 1 | county , \n        data= pmdf ,  \n        xlab= \"County\", \n        ylab= \"AQI\" ,\n        main= \"AQI vs county\" , \n        panel= panel.violin, \n        horizontal= FALSE )\n\n# formula expression: ~ x | gfactor\nbwplot(~ AQI | county , \n       data= pmdf ,  \n       xlab= \"County\", \n       ylab= \"AQI\" ,\n       main= \"AQI vs county\" , \n       fill= c( \"gray\", \"brown\", \"cyan\" ) , \n       varwidth= TRUE )\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n\n \nMost functions to graphically or numerically summarize data conditional on the levels of another factor/grouping variable (`gfactor`) use the general layout of `task( y ~ x | gfactor, data )` or  `task( ~ y | gfactor, data )`.\n\n\n \n  \n\n  \n \n\n"},"formats":{"html":{"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"knitr"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-yaml":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"show","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":true,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[]},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","output-file":"numsum.html"},"language":{},"metadata":{"lang":"en","fig-responsive":true,"quarto-version":"1.0.35","bibliography":["references.bib"],"knitr":{"opts_chunk":{"collapse":true,"comment":"#>","echo":true,"message":false,"fig.align":"center","warning":false,"prompt":false,"eval":true,"results":"show"}},"theme":"cyborg","cover-image":"cover.jpeg","editor_options":{"markdown":{"wrap":72}}},"extensions":{"book":{"multiFile":true}}}}}
