A study by @pratt2021trade investigated the trade-offs\n(costs and benefits of different traits) among different xylem functions\nin shrub species and how they are influenced by minimum hydrostatic pressures  experienced by plants in the field. The study, which used structural equation modeling, showed the importance of understanding that the roles of different cell types in the xylem are important for recognizing the functional trade-offs that govern xylem traits, and emphasized the critical role of minimum hydrostatic pressures in plant growth and development.\n\nFor their study, various plant physiological measurements for 29\ndifferent plant species were collected. Below is a list and small description of each variable:\n\n- P75: the water potential at 75% loss of its hydraulic conductivity (MPa). \n\n- Ks: a measure of xylem-specific conductivity.  (kg s$^{-1}$ MPa$^{-1}$ m$^{-1}$).\n\n- Starch: amount of starch content in the xylem tissues (%). \n\n- Xylem density:  measure of the density of xylem (dry mass/tissue volume) .\n\n- Fiber percentage: the proportion of fibers in the xylem tissue. \n\n- Vessel percentage: the proportion of vessels in the xylem tissue.\n\n- Parenchyma percentage: the proportion of parenchyma cells in the xylem tissue. \n\n- Pmin: Minimum level of dehydration a plant can experience (MPa).\n\n- Water storage capacity: the capacity of the xylem tissue to store water $\\Delta \\text{Relative water content}/\\Delta \\text{MPa}$.  \n\nThese variables provide insight on how the xylem functions.\n\nHere, we apply principal component analysis (PCA) to determine if we can\nidentify key patterns in these data, which\ndescribe various aspects related to the structure, function, and\nproperties of xylem, as well as underlying factors or dimensions that may be\ndriving the variation in the data. The data are shown in the table below.\n\n```{r, xylemcs }\n#| echo: false\n#| message: false\n#| warning: false\n#| results: 'asis'\n#| fig.width: 7\n#| fig.height: 3\n#| fig.align: 'center'\n\nrequire(dplyr)\nrequire(readxl)\nlibrary(kableExtra)\nlibrary(DT)\n\nxylemDF <- read_xlsx(\"datasets/PlantWaterPhysiology.xlsx\")\nxylemDF <-xylemDF %>% mutate_if(is.character, factor)\n\nxylemDF2 <- xylemDF %>% rename(`xylem density`=xylem_density,\n                              `fiber %`=`fiber_%`,\n                              `vessel %`=`vessel_%`,\n                              `parenchyma %` =`par_%` ,\n                              `Pmin`= Pmin,\n                              `water storage cap.`=water_storage) \ndatatable( xylemDF2 , class=\"hover\", style=\"bootstrap4\", rownames=FALSE,   height=250,  fillContainer = T, caption=\"Data from Pratt et al.

The third PC, on the other hand, may be considered as an indicator of the adaptability of shrubs to drought conditions in terms of their capacity to balance parenchyma and fiber to maintain essential plant functions.  These findings provide a view into how these shrubs respond to water availability in a semi-arid chaparral environment.  \n \n It is important to note that PCA is an exploratory method rather than an inferential one. While it can reveal patterns and relationships in the data, it does not provide statistically significant conclusions or results.
