Do external incentives promote creativity? To address this, researchers investigated whether people would tend to display more creativity when they are thinking about intrinsic or extrinsic motivations [@amabile1985 and @sleuth]. In this study, undergraduate students of similar creative writing experience were randomly assigned to one of two groups . One group received intrinsic questionnaires, and the other received extrinsic questionnaires. \n\nThe intent of this treatment (the questionnaires) was to have student establish a thought pattern concerning a type of motivation (intrinsic -- doing something because it is rewarding or enjoyable; extrinsic -- doing something because we want to earn a reward or avoid punishment).  Researchers speculated that those who were thinking about intrinsic motivations would display more creativity than subjects who were thinking about extrinsic motivations. All subjects were instructed to write a Haiku, and those poems were evaluated for creativity by a panel of judges\n\nThe resulting experimental data is shown below, displaying the creativity score (`Score`) and the type of questionnaires (`Treatment`) assigned for a given undergraduate.
